##  The Project's Purpose and Rationale

<p align="justify">   
Human trafficking is a devastating crime that impacts millions worldwide. It entails taking advantage of helpless people who are coerced into labor or prostitution against their will. The sensation of having their freedom and dignity taken away is typical among human trafficking victims, who come from many walks of life.

Imagine being deprived of all you know and love and being compelled to work in perilous situations with no escape. Many human trafficking victims experience this awful scenario because they are frequently misled by promises of a better life and forced into a life of misery and pain.

There is no consensus about the real magnitude of the issue but the fact that each number represents a lost human life is what matters. Whether where we live is a source, destination, or transit location for trafficking, it occurs on every continent and in practically every nation.

Even the scope of this issue can make one feel demoralized, discouraged, and disheartened, but it's important to remember that every human trafficking victim is someone's family or friend, and like the rest of us, they have hopes and dreams, but because of the greed and cruelty of others, their lives have been destroyed.

The pressing imperative remains and mandates that we, as a global community, must do everything to eliminate this crime. Millions of people caught in this cycle of exploitation can change their lives if we raise awareness, fund anti-trafficking organizations, and advocate for stricter laws and regulations.

##  Repository Details

The following is a comprehensive analysis of Alberta's Human Trafficking records based on official data sources provided by Statistics Canada. The study primarily focuses on data from the last five years (2017-2021), as the quality of data for previous years is sparse and cannot be relied upon for accuracy. The study examines actual incidents of human trafficking, the rate of human trafficking per 100,000 population, the percentage change in the rate of human trafficking, and the number of unfounded incidents reported during the given period.

Human trafficking is a severe crime that involves the exploitation of individuals through forced labor, sexual exploitation, or other forms of coercion. It is a significant concern for law enforcement agencies, policymakers, and advocacy groups worldwide.

The analysis will examine the following characteristics: 

* Actual incidents of Human Trafficking 
* Rate of Human Trafficking  per 100,000 population
* Percentage change in the rate of Human Trafficking 
* Number of unfounded incidents reported

The study's focus on actual incidents of human trafficking provides an insight into the number of reported cases in Alberta during the given period. The rate of human trafficking per 100,000 population provides an understanding of the prevalence of this crime in Alberta. Moreover, the percentage change in the rate of human trafficking provides an understanding of the trends in human trafficking cases over the years, which can aid in policymaking and resource allocation. By understanding these factors, we hope to shed light on the extent of the human trafficking problem in Alberta and how it's changed over the years.

Overall, this study sheds light on the extent of the human trafficking problem in Alberta and can help inform policy and resource allocation decisions in combating this crime.
